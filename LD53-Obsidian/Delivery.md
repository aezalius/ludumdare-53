1. the action of delivering letters, packages, or ordered goods.

## Ideas:

	1. Space delivery service? (Playing too much DRG recently...)
	2. **Eldritch delivery service**
	3. Keep in the cart
2. Reverse tower defense
	1. Break through the base to deliver a package to the ruler of a dungeon forcefully.

### Eldritch delivery service
"You are a mortal collecting and delivering much needed... supplies to various beings"

Game starts being dropped off from a van, head to a spot to collect the job.

### Color template ideas
**Agressive, very red**

Fairly eldritch, might be a bit hard to stand out in it.

### Basic idea
Player accepts requests from various beings to collect and bring back items and parts from around the area.
The player cannot fight when holding a package, and must avoid the creatures on the way back.
Normally creatures around only aggro if you get close enough, but holding things makes all creatures on screen aggro.

Of course, couriers don't have weapons, that would be unprofessional!

### Code
spawn enemies off screen, if they enter the area, the aggro.

### Tiles needed
