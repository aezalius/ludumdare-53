1. the action of delivering letters, packages, or ordered goods.

## Ideas:
1. Delivery service
	1. Space delivery service? (Playing too much DRG recently...)
	2. **Eldritch delivery service**
	3. Keep in the cart
2. Reverse tower defense
	1. Break through the base to deliver a package to the ruler of a dungeon forcefully.
3. 


### Eldritch delivery service
"You are a mortal collecting and delivering much needed... supplies to various beings"

Game starts being dropped off from a van, head to a spot to collect the job.

**Agressive, very red**

nice looking, simple

Fairly eldritch, might be a bit hard to stand out in it.

### Basic idea
Player accepts requests from various beings to collect and bring back items and parts from around the area.
The player cannot fight when holding a package, and must avoid the creatures on the way back.
Normally creatures around only aggro if you get close enough, but holding things makes all creatures on screen aggro.

Of course, couriers don't have weapons, that would be unprofessional!

### Game Loop
##### Start
Start game in front of the main office, go and interact with your boss.

##### Main Loop
Boss generates some request for you, to go and collect some items out in the world and bring them to a client, then return to the office. 

### TODO:
1. Generate a quest
	1. ~~Hold a reference to the level script in the questhandler~~
	2. ~~Have the questhandler poll the level script for information to generate a quest
		1. encounter instances from the level
		2. delivery clients from the level
		3. 
	3. ~~Pass that enounter information into a quest instance
	4. ~~Plug this information into the dialogue box
2. Make some encounters and clients
3. customize the package based on the encounter
4. move to a dialogue handler instead of splitting important features across stuff
5. replace bad pixel art

### Todo for Monday
1. Build out world
2. Place 3-ish delivery clients
	1. Ag'roth, a mass of flesh who is oddly nice
	2. Jeff, a Jeff
	3. 
3. Build 3 or 4 encounters
	1. Wizard, who summons exploding circles
	2. The bow-man group
	3. Pack of little angry dudes, just a ton of little guys who chase super far
	4. One big burly guy who leaps at you
4. Stretch:
	1. Add some action other than rolling
	2. Main menu
	3. intro cutscene?
